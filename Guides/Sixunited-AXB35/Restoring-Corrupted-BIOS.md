# Restoring Corrupted BIOS

Some people successfully bricked their PC when updating the BIOS and apart from manually flashing the ROM itself there doesn't seem to be any options. The following guide describes how to restore the BIOS ROM on the [[AXB35 board|Hardware/Boards/Sixunited-AXB35]] ([[GMKtec EVO-X2 PC|Hardware/PCs/GMKtec-EVO-X2]]), also mentioning basic details for the EC one.

#### Prerequisites

Both ROM chips are located on the back side of the motherboard, so the PC needs to be disassembled first. Refer to this video for disassembly:

Items required for BIOS ROM (W25R256JWEQ) programming:
- CH341A programmer
- 1.8V adapter, as the ROM operates at 1.8V
- WSON8-compatible probe (the one included with the CH341A is not suitable)
- programming PC (Windows was used this time)
- programming software (AsProgrammer v3.17)
- valid BIOS ROM (grab it from [[Firmware|Hardware/Boards/Sixunited-AXB35/Firmware]] page)
- (optional) a spare W25R256JWEQ chip to test your setup
- (optional) soldering equipment and skills

All components can be purchased from Amazon or AliExpress. Be cautious when ordering the WSON8 probe - ensure it's the 8x6 mm variant, as 5x6 mm variants exist and are not compatible.


#### BIOS ROM Flashing Process

> [!WARNING]
> Follow static electricity precautions throughout this procedure, especially during seasonal conditions with low humidity.

**Step 1: Test ROM Programming (Recommended)**
1. Connect the test ROM chip to the CH341A. You may need to hold the chip down with a clip if the included cover won't close normally.
2. Launch AsProgrammer and detect the ROM chip.
3. **Unlock the ROM** if a protection bit is set (AsProgrammer should prompt you).
4. Write, then read and verify the ROM to ensure your setup works correctly.
5. Once you're sure that everything works fine, proceed to the next step.

**Step 2: Program the ROM**
1. Connect the WSON8 probe to the W25R256JWEQ chip on the motherboard.
2. Launch AsProgrammer and detect the ROM chip.
3. **Unlock the ROM** if a protection bit is set (AsProgrammer should prompt you).
4. Load your BIOS image file and initiate the write operation.
5. **Keep the probe steady for the entire duration** - this could take several minutes and poor contact will lead to write errors.
6. After writing completes, verify that the ROM contents match your image file.

**Step 3: Lock the ROM**  
You have two options to re-lock the ROM:
- use AsProgrammer to lock the ROM before reassembly
- reassemble the PC, boot into Windows, and re-flash the BIOS using the manufacturer's official BIOS update tool; this will re-lock the ROM through normal firmware procedures


#### Alternative Method: Desoldering

Alternatively, If you have soldering experience and equipment, you can desolder the ROM chip and flash it externally without needing a probe. Of course there are risks of damaging the motherboard, so only attempt if you know what you're doing.
