## Strix Halo HomeLab

![Strix Halo APU](./strix-halo.jpg)

**Welcome to the Strix Halo HomeLab wiki!**

The purpose of this website is to gather all important information related to systems with AMD Ryzen AI MAX and MAX+ in home lab applications, so most of the [[guides|Guides]] are very Linux-centric, but there is also some information on [[Strix Halo PCs|Hardware/PCs]] and [[boards|Hardware/Boards]].

My personal use case is the following:
 - AI MAX+ 395 with 128G of RAM
 - VRAM allocation is 64G
 - Proxmox as the host system
 - Windows VM with iGPU passed through, for gaming and LLMs
 - Linux VMs for NAS and other services
