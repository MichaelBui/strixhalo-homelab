### Welcome to the Strix Halo Wiki!

The purpose of this website it to gather important information and practical guides for systems powered by AMD Ryzen AI MAX and MAX+ processors. Our [[guides|Guides]] cover various topics and of course there is a separate section for [[the AI ones|AI]]. You can also find some information on [[Strix Halo PCs|Hardware/PCs]] and [[boards|Hardware/Boards]].

**Common use cases include:**
- LLM development and inference systems
- High-performance workstations
- Virtualization hosts running multiple VMs
- Gaming systems
- Home servers and NAS solutions

Whether you're researching systems to purchase (by the way, we have [[a guide|Guides/Buyer's_Guide]] for that too!), setting up your first Strix Halo PC or troubleshooting issues, this wiki aims to provide the information you need.

Hope it helps :)
