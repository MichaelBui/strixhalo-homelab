### Thoughts
 - is available already, the pricing varies dramatically: resellers in UK and Germany sell the 128G version for under 3600 USD
 - the cooling solution looks very similar to the Sixunited's one, but has a beefier heatsink
 - supposedly the CPU can do short burst up to 160W, 120W is still the maximum for sustained load
 - ECC memory is an option (not default)
