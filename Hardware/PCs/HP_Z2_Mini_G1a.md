### Thoughts & Facts
 - the pricing varies dramatically: resellers in UK and Germany sell the 128G version for under 3600 USD
 - the PC features the [PRO version of the CPU](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen-pro/ai-max-pro-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-pro-395.html), which allows for full memory encryption along with DASH and AiMT support (AMD KVM/Remote Management)
 - the CPU can do short burst up to 160W, 120W is still the maximum for sustained load
 - the cooling solution looks very similar to the Sixunited's one, but has a beefier heatsink and is considerably noisier
 - ECC memory is an option (not default), however it's not clear if there are configurations with a proper ECC memory or it's just a standard DDR5 correction + ECC link (which exists on all Strix Halo systems)
 - 10gbe option is Marvell AQC113
 - m.2 "performance" option is Samsung PM9A1
