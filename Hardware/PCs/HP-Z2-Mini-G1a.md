### Thoughts
 - seems to be available already, but the pricing is insane, $4500+ for a 128G version (could be bought much cheaper in the UK for some reason)
 - the cooling solution looks very similar to the Sixunited's one, but has a beefier heatsink
 - supposedly the CPU can do short burst up to 160W, 120W is still the maximum for sustained load
 - ECC memory is an option (not default)
