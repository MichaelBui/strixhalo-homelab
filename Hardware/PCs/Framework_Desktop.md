### Useful add-ons for the Framework mainboard

- Don't need Wifi? You can use [A+E-key M.2 2230 drives](https://cwwk.net/products/cwwk-256g-m-2-a-e-key-2230-ssd) in the Wifi slot as boot drives, leaving the 2xM2 slots for RAID1 volumes for faster local model storage, or to proffer 2x Ceph OSDs to cluster SAN if that's your thing. 
- 10GBit/s NICs built on the DB795M. They are PCIe 3.0 x4, no riser required. Bifurcation also doesn't seem to be required. The board includes a PLX. Get them for example at [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/p/wiki/article.html?keywords=xikestor-skn-2bt-m2).
